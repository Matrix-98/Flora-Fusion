Project Overview

This Arduino code interfaces with a Si7021 temperature and humidity sensor, a BH1750 light intensity sensor, and a 16x2 I2C LCD display, and it adds functionality for switching between two screens using a push button. The two screens display different sensor data: one for temperature and humidity, and the other for light intensity. The push button toggles between these two screens, providing a simple user interface for the display.

Libraries Used

- Wire.h: Used for I2C communication.
- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h: Provides functions for controlling the LCD over I2C.
- BH1750.h: Provides functions for interfacing with the BH1750 light sensor.

Code Explanation

1. Setup:
   - Initializes serial communication with Serial.begin(9600) for debugging.
   - Initializes I2C communication with Wire.begin().
   - Initializes the LCD with lcd.begin(16, 2) for a 16x2 display.
   - Sets up the button pin for input (BUTTON_PIN 8) to toggle between screens.
   - Initializes the BH1750 light sensor with lightMeter.begin().

2. Screen Toggle:
   - The screenState boolean variable tracks which screen is currently active (false for temperature/humidity, true for light intensity).
   - A debounce technique is implemented for the button to avoid multiple presses being registered at once.

3. Sensor Updates:
   - The program reads data from the sensors every 5 seconds (sensorUpdateInterval) and updates the LCD accordingly.
   - The push button allows the user to toggle between displaying temperature/humidity and light intensity data on the LCD screen.

Expected Outputs

- LCD Output: The LCD alternates between displaying the temperature and humidity or the light intensity, depending on the screen state toggled by the button.
- Serial Output: Sensor data may also be printed to the serial monitor for debugging and monitoring.

Conclusion

This code extends the basic sensor monitoring setup by adding a button for screen switching. It allows users to easily toggle between viewing different types of sensor data on the LCD display, making it a versatile solution for simple environmental monitoring projects.
