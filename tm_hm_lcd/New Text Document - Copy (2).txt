This Arduino code interfaces with a Si7021 temperature and humidity sensor, a BH1750 light intensity sensor, and a 16x2 I2C LCD display. It initializes the LCD and sensors using I2C communication, resets the Si7021 sensor, and checks its presence. The code is designed to read data from the sensors and display it on the LCD, while also sending the data to the serial monitor for debugging. The program serves as a basic foundation for environmental monitoring projects, allowing easy integration of temperature, humidity, and light intensity readings with a simple LCD interface
